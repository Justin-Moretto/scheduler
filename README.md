# Interview Scheduler
This is a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews.
Built with the intention of learning React, Axios, Storybook, Jest and Cypress.

Users may select available date/time slots and book appointments with interviewer who is scheduled for that day.
They may also edit and delete appointments.

Here is my back-end's repo: https://github.com/Justin-Moretto/scheduler-api
